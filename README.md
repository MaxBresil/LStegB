# LStegB - LSB Image Steganography
The first time I discovered about LSB steganography implemented in image I thought it was a really cool way to hide informations in image without it being noticeable.
Then I documented myself to understand how it really works and how I could make my life easier when it come to this kind of challenge in CTF so I developped a brute-forcer !

## Built with
Nothing else but my own hands !
I'm currently writing this program in Python 3 but one of my objective would be to translate this one in C to gain in performance.
